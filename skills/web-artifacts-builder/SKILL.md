description: Suite of tools for creating elaborate, multi-component HTML artifacts using modern frontend web technologies (React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui). Use for complex artifacts requiring state management, routing, or shadcn/ui components - not for simple single-file HTML/JSX artifacts.

# Web Artifacts Builder

To build powerful frontend artifacts, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the frontend repo using `scripts/init-artifact.sh`
2. Develop your artifact by editing the generated code
3. Bundle all code into a single HTML file using `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh`
4. Display artifact to user by minting a new download URL for the bundle.html file created in step 3.

**Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Parcel (bundling) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

## Design & Style Guidelines

VERY IMPORTANT: To avoid what is often referred to as "AI slop", avoid using excessive centered layouts, purple gradients, uniform rounded corners, and Inter font.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Initialize Project

Run the initialization script to create a new React project:

```bash
bash scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

This creates a fully configured project with:

- ✅ React + TypeScript (via Vite)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 with shadcn/ui theming system
- ✅ Path aliases (`@/`) configured
- ✅ 40+ shadcn/ui components pre-installed
- ✅ All Radix UI dependencies included
- ✅ Parcel configured for bundling (via .parcelrc)
- ✅ Node 18+ compatibility (auto-detects and pins Vite version)

### Step 2: Develop Your Artifact

To build the artifact, edit the generated files. See **Common Development Tasks** below for guidance.

### Step 3: Bundle to Single HTML File

To bundle the React app into a single HTML artifact:

```bash
bash scripts/bundle-artifact.sh
```

This creates `bundle.html` - a self-contained artifact with all JavaScript, CSS, and dependencies inlined. This file can be directly shared in the user conversations.

**Requirements**: Your project must have an `index.html` in the root directory.

**What the script does**:

- Installs bundling dependencies (parcel, @parcel/config-default, parcel-resolver-tspaths, html-inline)
- Creates `.parcelrc` config with path alias support
- Builds with Parcel (no source maps)
- Inlines all assets into single HTML using html-inline

### Step 4: Share Artifact with User

Finally, mint a downloadable URL for the bundle.html file and share it in conversation with the user so they can view the file.

To do this:

1. Upload the bundle.html file to bluebag file output directory to retrieve a file ID
2. Use the retrieved file ID to mint a downloadable URL and share with the user
